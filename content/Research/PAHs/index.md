title: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) for Organic Electronics

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)s are a series of compounds comprised of multiple fused aromatic rings. Apart from their interesting and beautiful structures, their semiconductor properties are key components in the field of organic electronics, like Organic Field Effect Transistors (OFETs), Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) and Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs). 
In this topic, I am working on developing novel PAHs (helically curved, molecules containing non-benzenoid aromatic rings, heteroatom doped PAHs) for different functions. I am being train with a variety of skills, including complex organic synthesis (with emphasis on transformations with aromatic compounds), various characterization techniques, as well as fabrication and testing of organic electronic devices.
