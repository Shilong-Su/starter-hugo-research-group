abstract: A strategy for constructing organic nanotubes with defined lengths was developed by designing and synthesizing macrocycles with a β-alanine linker. Oligomeric hexakis(m-phenylene ethynylene) macrocycles with four macrocyclic units as molecular nanotubes can form potassium and proton channels across lipid bilayers, with the channels being open continuously for over 60 s.
